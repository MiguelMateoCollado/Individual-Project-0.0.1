# Individual-Project-0.0.1

This project is a web application that allows you to search, filter, and create video games. It uses an SQL database to store data on genres and platforms and an interface with multiple cards and a bar with filters and a search bar built with React. The application also includes responsive design to improve my skills with CSS and is very experimental as I try to integrate many things to improve it. It is designed to implement my knowledge of back-end and front-end with the tools React.js, Express, Sequelize, and the PostgreSQL database. 

I will continue making changes to improve the application.
